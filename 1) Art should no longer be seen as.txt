1) Art should no longer be seen as a race, but like hiking. Our highly competitive world often makes us forget this.

2) We don't all start our artistic journey at the same time. Some are late bloomers, others started earlier.

3) Let's imagine that we take our artistic journey in a symbolic car. Some cars are much heavily loaded than others. People with mental health or family problems may progress more slowly than others, but they shouldn't be ashamed or angry about it. They do the best they can with what they have.

4) Comparison is really not a good idea because humans only compare themselves to others in terms of what they don't have. So if you compare yourself to a lot of people who have what you don't have in different domains, you're bound to feel insecure. The solution (even if it's easier said than done) is to be "inspired" by them. These persons succeeded where you've failed? Okay, how did they do it? Sincere and honest admiration is much healthier than jealousy.
